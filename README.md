# Fermi Surface Visualization (Harrison Method)

## Background

This project implements the Harrison method to visualize different branches of the Fermi surface in reciprocal space. The Fermi surface is a crucial concept in solid-state physics, describing the set of electron states at the Fermi energy level. Understanding the geometry of the Fermi surface is essential for analyzing the electronic properties of materials.

## How to Use the Code

### Running the Program

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Modify the num_valence_electron variable in the **main** function to set the **number of valence electrons** per unit cell corresponding to the material of interest.

3. Adjust the **branch_index** variable to visualize the desired Fermi surface branch.

   Here is an example out put:

5. You can also use my idea and do other changes to get the Fermi surface of other 2D structures.
